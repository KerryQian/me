TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
[THINGS LEARNT THIS SET]
-- Fixed up some previous graphs, made edits and made sure the graphs looked presentable.
-- Read up a lot of problems I was having. The feeling of solving a problem through reading forums is the best.

[GOALS]
-- Try to annotate plots with school names
-- figure out Geopanda
