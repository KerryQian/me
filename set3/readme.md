TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
THINGS LEARNT THIS SET:
---- Exercise 1 ----
-- while loops
-- more into the "in" command (in range())
-- try/except statements
---- Exercise 2 ----
-- Example code on making a random generator as a game
-- uses an imported library called "random" to generate numbers
---- Exercise 3 ----
-- using code from exercise 2, trying to make a more complex guessing game that accepts miss inputs.
---- Exercise 4 ----
-- Binary search

COMMENTS:
-- Took a while in exercise 1 but exercise 3 was fun. Binary was also fun, pseudo code helps a lot with this exercise.
-- the default values for "in range()" is (start, stop, step)
-- Binary: finding an answer in a ordered list by averaging the min and max in every guess.
-- Binary search was a lot easier after doing Khan academy course.
-- "try" and "Except" are used to catch and handle exceptions so that your code can run when either miss inputs occur or when the code breaks.
