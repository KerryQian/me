TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
New topics:
    try/except statements
    while loops
    more into the "in" command (in range())
    fstrings
    Binary search

Took a while in exercise 1 but exercise 3 was fun. Binary was also fun, pseudo code helps a lot with this exercise.
Binary
    finding an answer in a ordered list by averaging the min and max in every guess.
