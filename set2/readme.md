TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.


learning for loops and troubleshooting
need to get a better understanding of for loops and .append (how are they different from while loops and +1)
loop 7 was not too hard, did it in comp1511. approach the question like a computer, think of a formula that would work
in this case
    let x and y = 0
    if x-4 is <= y
        print "*"
        otherwise print a space
increment the value of x until it hits the width of the triangle
and then increase the value of y and reset the value of x. Do this until Y reaches the height value of triangle
