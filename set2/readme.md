TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

THINGS LEARNT THIS SET:
---- Exercise 0 ----
-- Basic functions (adding numbers, strings, changing letters into uppercase)
---- Exercise 1 ----
-- Commenting and understanding code. It is really important to comment as it helps you and other people understand what and why you wrote something. !!! MAKE SURE TO COMMENT ON MORE DIFFICULT LINES OF CODE !!!
-- first introduction into arrays, for loops, and if else statements.
---- Exercise 2 ----
-- Correcting the syntax of pre written code.
-- Syntax will be something I think I will have a lot of trouble with.
-- Need to be able to identify syntax errors, luckily vscode is good at helping with that.
---- Exercise 3 ----
-- working with Boolean values (True / False)
-- closer look at if/else statements
-- Closer look at arrays and loops

COMMENTS:
-- need to get a better understanding of for loops and .append (how are they different from while loops and +1)
-- loop 7: approach the question like a computer, think of a formula that would work
in this case
let x and y = 0
if x-4 is <= y
print "\*" (vscode auto correct, don't actually print the slash)
otherwise print a space
increment the value of x until it hits the width of the triangle
and then increase the value of y and reset the value of x. Do this until Y reaches the height value of triangle
-- A string is text, or things that are to be treated as text. anything in quotation marks "" are treated as strings
-- the % sign looks at the remainder of an answer after the numbers are divided. Good way to use Boolean values fr answers.
